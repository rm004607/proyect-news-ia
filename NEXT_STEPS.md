## Next Steps

With additional time, the next iteration of this project would focus on performance optimization and scalability by introducing a caching layer in the backend. I would also enhance news relevance through topic-based filtering (AI, security, startups) and allow users to customize the length of generated summaries. Finally, I would explore implementing a daily or weekly curated tech news digest.
