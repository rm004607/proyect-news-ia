# Global News Hub - AI Tech News

Global News Hub is a modern platform that centralizes the most relevant news from the tech world, providing concise summaries generated by artificial intelligence for quick and efficient reading.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project Locally

The project is divided into two parts: a React frontend and a Node.js backend.

### 1. Clone the repository and install dependencies
```bash
# Install Frontend dependencies (root)
npm install

# Install Backend dependencies
cd back
npm install
```

### 2. Required Configuration (API Keys)
You will need to obtain your own keys for the system to work:
1. **NewsAPI**: Register at [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org/) to get a free API Key.
2. **Google Gemini**: Get your key at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).

### 3. Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file inside the `/back` folder (you can use `.env.example` as a template):
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
NEWS_API_KEY=your_newsapi_key
PORT=3001
```

### 4. Running the App
You should have both terminals running:
- **Backend**: `cd back && node index.js` (or `npm run dev` for watch mode).
- **Frontend**: In the root directory, run `npm run dev`.

## 🛠️ Technical Decisions and Trade-offs

- **Decoupled Backend (Express)**: An independent backend was chosen over Serverless Functions to allow better control over NewsAPI requests and ensure API Keys are never exposed to the client.
- **NewsAPI vs RSS**: Initially RSS was considered, but we switched to **NewsAPI** for more structured data, category filtering (technology), and broader global coverage natively.
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash**: The `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` model was selected for its extreme speed and low cost, ideal for text summarization tasks where latency is critical for user experience.
- **On-Demand Loading**: The frontend makes the request upon page load. *Trade-off*: If many users load the page simultaneously, free NewsAPI limits may be reached quickly. *Future Solution*: Implement a 15-minute caching system on the backend.

## 🤖 AI Tools Usage

This project was developed with an "AI-First" approach:

1. **Google Gemini 2.0 (Core)**: Used in the backend to process raw headlines and descriptions from NewsAPI and transform them into an executive summary in English.
2. **Antigravity (AI Architect)**: 
   - Designed the architecture connecting Front and Back.
   - Cleaned vulnerabilities and removed third-party branding.
   - Generated the project logo (`logo.png`) via image synthesis.
3. **News Summarization Prompt**: A specific prompt was designed for the AI to act as a "tech expert assistant," filtering noise and focusing on the impact of the news.

## 📋 Tools Used List

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion (animations).
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Axios (API requests), Dotenv (security).
- **IA**: Google Generative AI SDK (@google/generative-ai).
- **UI**: shadcn/ui (premium interface components).
