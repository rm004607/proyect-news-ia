## 🚀 How to Run the Project (Step by Step)

Follow these steps exactly to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Version 18 or higher)
- npm (Comes with Node.js)

### 2. Clone and Install Dependencies
Open a terminal in the project's root folder and run:

```bash
# Install all dependencies (Frontend and Backend)
npm run setup
```
> [!NOTE]
> This command will install dependencies in the root and also enter the `/back` folder to install the server's dependencies.

### 3. API Key Configuration (Required)
For the system to work, you need your own API keys. The backend will not function without them.

1.  **NewsAPI**: Register at [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org/) and get your free **API Key**.
2.  **Google Gemini**: Get your key at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).

### 4. Environment Variables
You must create a file named `.env` inside the `/back` folder.

1. Go to the `back/` folder.
2. Create a new file named `.env`.
3. Copy and paste the following, replacing with your keys:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key_here
NEWS_API_KEY=your_newsapi_key_here
PORT=3001
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure the file is named exactly `.env` and is inside the `back` folder. Do not create it in the project root.

### 5. Run the Application
You can now start both ends (Frontend and Backend) with a single command from the **project root**:

```bash
npm run dev:all
```

This will open:
- **Frontend**: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or your configured Vite port)
- **Backend**: [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

## 🛠️ Technical Decisions

-   **Decoupled Backend (Express)**: An independent backend was chosen to have full control over NewsAPI requests and ensure API Keys are never exposed to the client.
-   **Gemini 2.0 Flash**: The `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` model is used for its extreme speed and low cost, ideal for real-time summarization tasks.
-   **AI-First Architecture**: The project uses specific prompts for the AI to act as a "tech expert assistant," filtering out noise and focusing on the impact of the news.

## 📋 Technologies Used

-   **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, shadcn/ui.
-   **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Axios, Dotenv.
-   **AI**: Google Generative AI SDK (`@google/generative-ai`).

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

-   **Connection Error (Port 3001)**: If the frontend says it cannot connect, ensure the backend server is running on port 3001. You can verify this in the terminal after running `npm run dev:all`.
-   **Invalid Keys**: If summaries don't appear, check that your keys in `back/.env` are correct and don't have extra spaces.
-   **Dependencies**: If something fails at startup, try deleting the `node_modules` folders and running `npm run setup` again.
